The study includes analysis of:
- an exploratory study analysis based on analysis of 17 recorded programming sessions of practitioners using [Pharo](http://pharo.org),
- a complementary survey, and
- a subsequent analysis of 16 programming sessions in additional languages

## Exploratory Study

Transcript of the 17 sessions is available in an Org-Mode structured file: [transcripts.org.txt](./01-exploratory-study/transcripts.org.txt).

TODO:
- add transcripts
- add DFlow data (maybe as a CSV file)
- add Pharo image with the analysis tool

## Survey

The survey data are available at [02-survey](./02-survey) directory. It includes questions and responses.

## Subsequent Sessions

Subsequent video classification and links to video sources are available at [03-subsequent-videos](03-subsequent-videos) directory. It includes a CSV file.
