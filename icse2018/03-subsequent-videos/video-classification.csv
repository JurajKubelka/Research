He compiled the code using node.js regularly and checked if it works. He used console.log to check if code works. Using the console is very similar to evaluate code in Pharo inspectors. He also modified object variables in the console. At 1h9m45s is an example of exception errors (immediate feedback) in a browser console. At 1h27m53s he check if he can set a position by setting it in a console. He uses a nice browser feature “Store as Global Variable”.
